The main version of `spark-snowflake` works with Spark 2.4. For use with Spark 2.3 and 2.2, please use tag `vx.x.x-spark_2.3` and `vx.x.x-spark_2.2`. 

To use it, provide the dependency for Spark in the form of `net.snowflake:spark-snowflake_$SCALA_VERSION:$RELEASE`, e.g. `net.snowflake:spark-snowflake_2.11:2.2.2`. See [Spark Packages](https://spark-packages.org/package/snowflakedb/spark-snowflake) and [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cspark-snowflake) for more info.

For a version working with Spark 1.5 and 1.6, please use `branch-1.x`. Artifacts of that version are also available in the Snowflake UI.
